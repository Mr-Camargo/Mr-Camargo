# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is SebastiÃ¡n Camargo, although some people call me Camargo or Camargou.

I'm a young student that is a web and Javascript Mexican developer, director, owner, and founder of [Slash Studio](https://github.com/Slashy-Studio).

I have completed several boot camps and courses, like:

* [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/the-complete-web-development-course)
* [Codeacademy 'Learn Javascript' course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

I have experience working with Git using the command line and using GitHub.
