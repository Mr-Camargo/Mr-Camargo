# Hello there üëãüèº

My name is Sebasti√°n Camargo, although some people call me Camargo or Camargou.

I'm a young web and Javascript Mexican developer, director and owner of my own coding studio, [Slash Studio](https://github.com/Slashy-Studio).

I have completed several bootcamps and courses, these include:

* [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/the-complete-web-development-course)
* [Codeacademy 'Learn Javascript' course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

I'm currently developing a powerful Discord Bot, called Mirayoki.
