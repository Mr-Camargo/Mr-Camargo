# Hello! 👋🏼

**I am a teenager born in Mexico** 🇲🇽 seeking to reshape learning opportunities for all around the globe through [Institute Alterna](https://alterna.dev), an organization I founded based on my experiences of self-paced learning beyond the classroom.

One of my favorite aspects of computer science is cybersecurity. Isn't it fascinating that the same systems that hold information also protect it? I also enjoy 🚴🏼‍♂️ cycling, 🎛️ EDM, and 🍎 everything Apple.
