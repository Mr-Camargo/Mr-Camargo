# Hey! 🫰🏼

My name is **Sebastián Camargo**!

Simply a Mexican 🇲🇽 teenager who is looking to ✨*change the world*✨ using the power of coding and education.

My passion is to advocate for high-quality, open, free, and accessible education all around the globe. 🌎

That's why I founded [Institute Alterna](https://alterna.dev): to enable anyone to enjoy learning about computer science wherever they find themselves. I also care deeply about data privacy, and I'm into everything Apple! 🍎
