# Hello there 👋🏽

My name is Sebastián Camargo, although some people call me Camargo or Camargou.

I'm a Mexican student that is a web and Javascript developer, creator of [Mirayoki](https://github.com/Slashy-Studio/mirayoki), director, owner, and founder of [Slash Studio](https://github.com/Slashy-Studio).

I love riding my bike 🚴🏼‍♂️ and listening to music 🎧
