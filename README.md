# Hello there 🫰🏼

My name is **Sebastián Camargo**!

I am a Mexican 🇲🇽 teenager who is looking to ✨*change the world*✨ using the power of coding.

I like to advocate for data privacy all around the world 🌎. That's why projects I create and direct like [Project Mirayoki](https://github.com/mirei-org/mirayoki) are built around user's privacy. I am also the proud owner and founder of [Mirei](https://github.com/mirei-org), a start-up that focuses on creating the world's best experiences for everyone to enjoy. 🪄🌟

I am also into everything Apple 🍎 and I wish to one day make my way to the top of the mountain ⛰
