# Hello there 🫰🏼

I am **Sebastián Camargo**!

I am a Mexican 🇲🇽 teenager who is looking to ✨*change the world*✨ using the power of coding.

I advocate for data privacy all around the world. 🌎 That's why projects I create and direct like [Project Mirayoki](https://github.com/Slashy-Studio/mirayoki) are built around user's privacy. I am also owner and founder of [Slash Studio](https://github.com/Slashy-Studio), a start-up that focuses on creating the world's best experiences. 🪄🌟

I am also into everything Apple and I wish to make my way to the top of the mountain ⛰

If you wish to see samples of my work, reach me out or see more information about me, make sure to [visit my website](https://mr-camargo.github.io) <3~
